# saccadedetection
This is an algorithm for finding saccades based on the findpeaks function by identifying blinks and then deleting saccades within 120 ms of a blink. The data is from tobi eyetracking data, using the x and y pupil positions. The code graphs the y velocity and the magnitude of velocity over time.
